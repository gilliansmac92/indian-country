          <p>The United States-Mexico border region has long been a subject filled with differing opinions, conflicts, land battles and a fusion of identities that can cause some people to not feel like they belong on either side of it. For the indigenous peoples of the region, especially the Lipan Apache or “Light Gray People” (the people this particular project will focus on), the land has always been theirs alongside other indigenous tribes, and now there’s a battle for recognition and acknowledgement in two entirely different countries coupled with the already horrendous acts faced over time. The Lipan Apache are a product of displacement from Northern Mexico, as are many other groups of indigenous people. In the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, what was left of the Lipan Apache were displaced at the hands of not only Americans, but Mexicans as well, into groups alongside the Mescalero and the Chiricahua to form the Mescalero Apache Tribe. The battle for the acknowledgement of the Lipan Apache has been long and strenuous as neither country has budged regarding the acknowledgement.

          <h3>Acknowledgment (or lack thereof):
          <p>While the Lipan Apache are often recognized by universities, and even cities, they’re still not federally recognized and little information is available as to why that is. The Lipan apache as a whole are low in numbers as far as tribal registration goes (4,500 according to their website). Joining the Mescalero at the hands of the military caused the Lipan to dwindle and become a part of one larger group in terms of recognition and federal documents to this point. The state of Texas has acknowledged the Lipan Apache on multiple occasions and with that, that’s the closest the Lipan have been to receiving any type of recognition from the government. According to one source, the Lipan Apache have an application in process with the United States with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as work within Mexico to gain recognition as well, but documentation for either of those claims is very hard to find, and likely hidden in government documents yet to be seen. The reasoning as to why recognition is still a big search for the Lipan Apache remains unclear, in documents, often very little information is available about the Lipan, as they tend to appear in documents about other tribes
             <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Enter the citation data here, and it will appear as a pop-over!"></a>. <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--></p>
          <br><!--this creates a break, Which is great for creating space in a variety of situations. Note that this is the only way to add a line break into your HTML. Adding a blank line will not translate to more spacing. -->
          <p> There are many useful things that you can do in HTML, and here we will provide a list of some things that may be useful for creating your site:</p>
            <ul> <!-- This creates an "unorderd list", or basically bullet points. Use <ol> if you want an "ordered", or numbered list (and don't forget to close it!). -->
              <li>You can also create regular links to things without pop-over content. For example, <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki">this link</a> goes to the Indian Country Wiki. You may also make links open up in a new tab by adding the target attribute with the the blank value: <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki" target="blank">same link, but it opens in a new tab</a></li> <!-- Just replace the href url with your desired url, and the normal text("this link") for your link -->
              <li>You may also create <a href="#jump">links that jump to other parts of the page</a> by putting an id in the element you want to jump to (see the <u>Image Sources</u> heading below to see where to put the id), and then doing #id in the href.<!-- Each id must be unique to jump to it --></li>
              <li>You may also format your text in an number of ways, including by: <b>bolding</b>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphaszing</em>, <u>underlining</u> or by designating <strong>strong text</strong></li>
            </ul>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gc04RzW2Gj4?si=9EnQHWSZ76qnGW1y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
