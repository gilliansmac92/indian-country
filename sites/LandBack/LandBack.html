          <p>The Land Back Movement is a movement that has existed for generations and intends to reestablish Indigenous sovereignty and return the land to Indigenous hands <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Landback.” LANDBACK, 2021, landback.org/.">(Landback)</a>. This movement has acted as a way to spark recognition, reparation, and action in reclaiming lands that were originally Indigenous. However the campaign is more than just a fight for indigenous sovereignty, it has been described as “incorporating all dimensions of the right to be self-determining”<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="DeLancey, Deborah. “Decolonizing evaluation of Indigenous Land-based programs: A settler perspective on what we can learn from the landback movement.” Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, vol. 19, no. 44, 20 July 2023, p. 178, https://doi.org/10.56645/jmde.v19i44.773.">(DeLancey, 178).</a> According to the Landback website, this includes the reclamation of things other than land such as “language, ceremony, food, education, housing, healthcare, governance, medicine, and kinship.”</p>

              <p> </p>There was a recent resurgence of this historical movement in 2020, amidst rallies in South Dakota.

According to the LandBack website, the campaign is not controlled or owned by any single group or organization and the framework encourages all to imagine a world where Black, Indigenous, and people of color liberation can co-exist. The modern movement persists in many areas of the United States and continues to be a framework that aims to address and dismantle White Supremacy and colonialism through different gatherings, rallies, protests, and legal battles.

         <p>As dismantling white supremacy is a core idea behind the Land Back Movement, the campaign may take root in places and states that have a long history of colonialism and a presence of dominant white power. Minnesota is riddled with a long history of white settlement and genocide against Indigenous peoples, and many Minnesotans still identify strongly and take pride in this settler history <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Clark, Grace. “Towards Land Return: Indigenous Environmental Justice and White Resistance in Minnesota.” Tapestries: Interwoven Voices of Local and Global Identities, vol. 9, no. 1, 2020, p. 4, https://doi.org/https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/tapestries/vol9/iss1/5?utm_source=digitalcommons.macalester.edu%2Ftapestries%2Fvol9%2Fiss1%2F5&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages.">(Clark, 2).</a> Because of the powerful relationship with colonialism, there is strong resistance on behalf of white residents to enact change that would benefit Indigenous peoples. Despite strong pushback, the concepts of Land Back have manifested themselves for years within the state of Minnesota.</p>

	          <h3><b>University of Minnesota and the Violence of Land Grant Universities</b></h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Since the mid-to-late 2010s, the Indigenous communities of Minnesota have continued to exemplify the tenets of Land Back by recovering land stolen from them, forcing universities, administrations, and corporations to honor treaties, and healing cultural wounds that have resulted from land theft. The importance of this land cannot be overstated, as many Indigenous people continue to rely on forests and waterways as food sources and a source of cultural awareness and tradition keeping. Bands recovering this land is more than mere ownership, as Bois Forte Band Chairwoman Cathy Chavers explains, “[the] land is our identity. Without it, we are lost”.
<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Birnbaum, Margarita Martín-Hidalgo. “Restoring Lost Lands.” American Indian, Spring 2023, pp. 14–21.">(Birnbaum 2023)</a>. <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--></p>

            <p> The case of the University of Minnesota is an especially contentious one, especially as many similar debates and reclamations are happening within other land grant universities around the country (Michigan State being one of them). The Minnesota Indian Affairs Council’s TRUTH report laid bare the extent of violence, thievery, and treaty disregard committed by Minnesota and many other land grant universities, in turn. The TRUTH project is the “first of its kind” in the United States, offering an opportunity for a federal land grant university to truly reckon with its mistreatment and oppression of Indigenous peoples 
              <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“TRUTH Project.” Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, University of Minnesota, Mar. 2023, mn.gov/indian-affairs/truth-project/.">(TRUTH 2023)</a>. The report, created in collaboration with both Sioux and Ojibwe bands across Minnesota, found that the University of Minnesota had “committed genocide and ethnic cleansing of Indigenous peoples for financial gain”, an admission of guilt that most other universities have not adequately addressed <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“TRUTH Project.” Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, University of Minnesota, Mar. 2023, mn.gov/indian-affairs/truth-project/.">(TRUTH 2023)</a>. 
              More than just existing on land that was not theirs gained through violence, they are choosing to ignore and obscure Indigenous history. The tenets of Land Back encourage opportunities to refute this thinking. A major way to do this would be to transfer ownership of the land back to the community that it belongs to, allowing them to have more influence and control over their own history and its retelling. As we further reckon with the violence of land grant institutions, ineffective treatments such as land acknowledgments, and the refusal to recount Indigenous history, the need for Land Back policies just becomes more important.</p>

        <h3><b>Sucesses and What We Can Learn From Minnesota</b></h3>
        <hr>
          <p>There is much that can be learned and emulated from the various cases of Land Back reparations in Minnesota, especially in regard to other federal land in the Midwest. The Bois Forte Band of the Chippewa Nation, the Leech Lake Band of the Ojibwe Nation, and the Upper Sioux Community Band of the Dakota Nation have all been victorious in regaining land that was rightfully theirs.<p>
            <figure style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: left; width: 40%">
             <img src="img/YellowMedicine.jpg" width="100%">
             <figcaption><a href="#ImageSource">Image 2. Yellow Medicine Sioux Community</a></figure>
            </figure>
          <p> In the summer of 2022, nearly 12,000 acres of wrongfully taken land was returned to the Leech Lake band of the Ojibwe Nation in Northern Minnesota. Described as an “act[] of outright theft”, the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not have the consent of the majority of tribal members when they started selling the land <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Olson, Melissa. “Decades after Taking It, Feds Set to Return Minnesota Land to Leech Lake Band.” MPR News, MPR News, 6 Mar. 2023, www.mprnews.org/story/2022/05/18/decades-after-taking-it-feds-set-to-return-minnesota-land-to-leech-lake-band.">(Olson 2023)</a>. 
            The land reclamation is considered by tribal members to be a reaffirmation of their sovereignty and allows them to regain ownership and community with ancestral lands.<p>
          <p>In early 2023, the Bois Forte Band purchased more than 28,000 acres of “cherished forests” from timber companies, making this acquisition “the largest amount of ancestral land that any Native nation in the United States has yet recovered” as of Spring 2023 <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Upper Sioux Community and State of Minnesota Mark the Return of Sacred Land : Mar 15, 2024: News Release.” Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 16 Mar. 2024, www.dnr.state.mn.us/news/2024/03/15/upper-sioux-community-and-state-minnesota-mark-return-sacred-land#:~:text=News%20release%3A%20Upper%20Sioux%20Community,the%20return%20of%20sacred%20land&text=This%20morning%2C%20tribal%20and%20state,Sioux%20Community%20(Pezihutazizi%20Oyate).">(MDNR 2024)</a>.
            The woodlands around Nett Lake that were recovered by the Band are of vital importance not only for cultural reasons but for the upholding of the Band’s food sovereignty measures as well (wild rice grows in abundance in Nett Lake and other waterways on the land). </p>
          <p>On March 15, 2024, ownership of the Upper Sioux Agency State Park was transferred to the Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County. In 1862, many Dakota people starved to death when “the United States government did not provide food promised by treaty”, marking another example of the cultural importance of land belonging to Indigenous peoples <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Birnbaum, Margarita Martín-Hidalgo. “Restoring Lost Lands.” American Indian, Spring 2023, pp. 14–21.">(Birnbaum 2023)</a>. 
            With Minnesota’s DNR specifically acknowledging the disrespect of operating a state park on this land, opening a joint effort between tribal, state, and federal departments, and setting a precedent for future Land Back initiatives, Minnesota and the sovereign tribes that have worked with them are helping to solidify Land Back as a legitimate practice.</p>
